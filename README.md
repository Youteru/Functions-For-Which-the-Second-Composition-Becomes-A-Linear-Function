On Discrete Monotonic Increasing Functions For Which the Second Composition Becomes A Linear Function

Abstract
The aim of this study is the monotonic increasing function from N to N of which the second composition f ◦ f becomes a linear function.
For give integers b and c,if f(f(x))=bx+c for each x,f has some regularities.Besides,this indicates a general term of f(x) and a relationship 
between f(x) and Padovan Sequence.Also,the study shows a Python source code which calculates f(x).
